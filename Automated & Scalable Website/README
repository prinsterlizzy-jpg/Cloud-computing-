Project Title

Automated and Scalable Website Using AWS
Project Description

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple website on AWS using cloud best practices.
The website runs on EC2, installs NGINX automatically using User Data, and scales automatically based on traffic with Auto Scaling and Load Balancer. CloudWatch is used for monitoring.
Services Used
	•	Amazon EC2
	•	User Data
	•	Security Groups
	•	Application Load Balancer
	•	Auto Scaling
	•	Amazon CloudWatch
How the Project Works
	1.	A user accesses the website through a Load Balancer.
	2.	Traffic is routed to EC2 instances.
	3.	User Data automatically installs and starts NGINX on each EC2.
	4.	CloudWatch monitors CPU usage.
	5.	Auto Scaling adds or removes EC2 instances based on traffic.
User Data Script
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install nginx -y
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
echo "<h1>Welcome! This server was set up automatically using AWS User Data.</h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
Security
	•	IAM is used to control access
	•	Security Groups restrict traffic
	•	Root account is not used
Outcome
	•	Automated server setup
	•	High availability
	•	Scalable infrastructure
	•	Beginner-friendly cloud project
