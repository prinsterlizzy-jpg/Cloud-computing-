# AWS EC2 Website Mini Project

## Project Overview
This project shows how to host a simple website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an EC2 instance and NGINX web server.

The goal of this project is to understand basic cloud concepts such as servers, security groups, and web hosting.

---

## Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon Linux
- NGINX
- Security Groups
- Default VPC

---

## Project Architecture
User → Internet → EC2 (Public Subnet) → NGINX → Website

---

## Steps Taken
1. Created an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux (Free Tier).
2. Configured a security group to allow:
   - SSH (Port 22) from my IP
   - HTTP (Port 80) from anywhere
3. Connected to the EC2 instance using SSH.
4. Installed and started the NGINX web server.
5. Deployed a simple HTML website.
6. Tested the website using the EC2 public IP.

---

## Result
The website was successfully hosted and accessible through a web browser using the EC2 public IP address.

---

## Security Measures
- SSH access was restricted to my IP address.
- Only HTTP traffic was allowed publicly.
- No sensitive credentials were shared or stored in the repository.

---

## Cleanup
All AWS resources used in this project were stopped or terminated after testing to avoid unnecessary charges.

## What I Learned
- How to launch and manage an EC2 instance
- Basic Linux commands
- How security groups work
- How to host a website using NGINX on AWS
